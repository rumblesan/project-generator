# The Programming Project Generator

Pretty often, I find myself wanting some sort of programming project. Nothing too major, but something to give me an excuse to learn a new language, or a concept, or just keep myself amused.

The obvious solution to this problem is to build a little app that will generate projects for me.

Some of the things this spews out won't make a whole lot of sense (building VMs in VMs for example), but it's really just meant to give me ideas for things to do.

If you think it's missing some possibilities then just send me a pull request.
